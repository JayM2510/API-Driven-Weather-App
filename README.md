## üå®Ô∏èDescription :
In this project, we propose a Weather Application using API(Application Programming Interface). Since Weather is something everybody deals with, and accurate data of it like what is coming can help users to make inform decisions.
With Weather apps for iOS and Android, people can exactly know when to expect a change in the weather conditions. Weather apps can give urgent alerts too.

## ‚òÄÔ∏èAPI used :
The `OpenWeatherMap API` currently provides a wide variety of weather data including (but not limited to) current weather, forecasts, historical, weather stations, and weather alerts.

The API also provides current and historical air pollution data such as carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). This feature is currently in beta and air pollution historical information goes back to November 2015.

## üíªPython - GUI Programming (Tkinter) :
Tkinter is the standard GUI library for Python. Python when combined with Tkinter provides a fast and easy way to create GUI applications. Tkinter provides a powerful object-oriented interface to the Tk GUI toolkit.
